# SplineDraw

SplineDraw is a test program I wrote to explore converting Catmull-Rom splines to Bezier curves.  This project was a prototyle for similar code I later added to my [LaserCut](https://github.com/wholder/LaserCut) program as a way to draw and the laser cut freeform shapes.

## Credit and Thanks

This project would have been much harder and much less cool without help from the following open source projects, or freely available software.

- [IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (my favorite development environment for Java coding. Thanks JetBrains!)
- See the source code for additional references to information and code I found helpful.
